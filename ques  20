1. Reverse a String Without Using Built-in Functions

Write a program to reverse a given string without using any built-in string functions.

Example:

    Input: hello

    Output: olleh

2. Check if Two Strings are Anagrams

Write a program that checks if two strings are anagrams (i.e., both strings contain the same characters but in a different order). The program should be case-insensitive.

Example:

    Input: listen, silent

    Output: Yes, they are anagrams

3. Count Vowels and Consonants in a String

Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string. Assume that the string contains only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

Example:

    Input: hello world

    Output: Vowels: 3, Consonants: 7

4. Remove All Occurrences of a Character in a String

Write a program that removes all occurrences of a given character from a string.

Example:

    Input: hello world, Character to remove: o

    Output: hell wrld

5. Find the First Non-Repeating Character in a String

Write a program to find the first non-repeating character in a string. If no such character exists, return -1.

Example:

    Input: swiss

    Output: w

6. Substring Search

Write a program to find if a given string is a substring of another string. Print the starting index of the substring in the string. If not found, print -1.

Example:

    Input: hello world, Substring: world

    Output: 6

7. Count the Number of Words in a String

Write a program to count the number of words in a given string. Assume that words are separated by spaces.

Example:

    Input: This is a test string

    Output: 5

8. Convert a String to Uppercase and Lowercase

Write a program that converts a given string to both uppercase and lowercase. You are not allowed to use the built-in toupper or tolower functions.

Example:

    Input: Hello World

    Output:

        Uppercase: HELLO WORLD

        Lowercase: hello world

9. Remove Whitespace from a String

Write a program to remove all spaces from a string. Do not use built-in functions like strtok.

Example:

    Input: hello world how are you

    Output: helloworldhowareyou

10. Palindrome Ignoring Non-Alphanumeric Characters

Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and considering case insensitivity.

Example:

    Input: A man, a plan, a canal, Panama

    Output: Yes, it is a palindrome

11. Count the Occurrence of Each Character in a String

Write a program that counts how many times each character appears in a given string.

Example:

    Input: hello

    Output:

        h: 1

        e: 1

        l: 2

        o: 1

12. Find the Longest Word in a String

Write a program to find the longest word in a given string. If multiple words have the same length, return the first one.

Example:

    Input: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

    Output: quick

13. String Compression (Run-Length Encoding)

Write a program that compresses a string using run-length encoding. The program should replace consecutive duplicate characters with the character followed by the number of occurrences.

Example:

    Input: aaabbbcccaaa

    Output: a3b3c3a3

14. Remove Duplicate Characters in a String

Write a program to remove all duplicate characters from a string while preserving the order of characters in the original string.

Example:

    Input: aabbccddeeff

    Output: abcdef

15. Count Substring Occurrences in a String

Write a program to count how many times a substring occurs in a string.

Example:

    Input: ababab, Substring: ab

    Output: 3

16. Reverse Words in a String

Write a program to reverse each word in a string while keeping the order of the words intact.

Example:

    Input: hello world

    Output: olleh dlrow

17. Check if a String is a Rotational Version of Another

Write a program that checks if one string is a rotational version of another. For example, abcd and dabc are rotations of each other.

Example:

    Input: abcd, dabc

    Output: Yes, they are rotations of each other

18. Find All Palindromes in a String

Write a program that finds all substrings of a given string that are palindromes.

Example:

    Input: aabbcc

    Output: a, bb, cc

19. Convert String to Integer (atoi)

Write a program that converts a string to an integer without using the built-in atoi() function.

Example:

    Input: "12345"

    Output: 12345

20. Find the Frequency of a Word in a String

Write a program to find how many times a specific word appears in a string.

Example:

    Input: hello world hello hello

    Word to find: hello

    Output: 3
